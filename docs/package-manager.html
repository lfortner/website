KISS PACKAGE MANAGER
________________________________________________________________________________

The KISS package manager is a self-contained POSIX shell script which is written
in a highly portable way. The entire utility comes in at under 1000 lines of
code (excluding blank lines/comments of which there are many).

The package manager is merely an implementation of the package format, its
requirements and some added sugar on top.

<span id=2.0><a href=#2.0>[2.0]</a></span> Dependencies
________________________________________________________________________________

POSIX utilities are used where appropriate _and_ where they exist to solve a
particular problem. Utilities of which there is only a single and cross-platform
implementation are considered "portable" (git, curl, etc)

If a dependency can be made optional, it will be made so. Dependencies are also
kept to a minimum (though we must also remain realistic).

<span id=1><a href=#1>[1]</a></span> Git is also required for contribution to the distribution itself. Strictly
    speaking, nothing forces you to use git. Remote repositories and git based
    sources will simply become unusable.

<span id=2><a href=#2>[2]</a></span> There is no standard utility for the generation of sha256 checksums. While
    sha256sum is listed above, the package manager also supports sha256, shasum
    and openssl as fallbacks.

<span id=3><a href=#3>[3]</a></span> The tar command has no standard! This came as a shock. The POSIX equivalent
    is "pax" though this isn't in wide use (at least on Linux).

    Our usage of tar is merely, cf, xf and tf. A patch is applied to sbase's
    tar so that it supports "dashless" arguments (as all others do). Our usage
    of tar cannot become any more basic than it is now. Portability should no
    longer be a concern.

    Tested tar implementations include: busybox, toybox, sbase, GNU and
    libarchive (though all tar implementations should work in theory).

<span id=4><a href=#4>[4]</a></span> These three compression methods are required as pretty much every package
    source uses them as the tarball compression method.

    The other compression methods are optional as no package sources (in the
    official repositories) make use of them.

    If a compression method has 1-3 uses (hasn't yet happened), the compression
    method will simply become a 'make' dependency of the package until usage
    increases to a "normality".

<span id=5><a href=#5>[5]</a></span> A privilege escalation utility is only needed when using the package
    manager as a normal user for system-wide package installation.

    Installation to a user-writable directory does not require root access.

    Root usage of the package manager (chroot usage for example) does not
    require these utilities.

<span id=6><a href=#6>[6]</a></span> If these are missing, binary stripping and/or the dependency fixer will
    simply be disabled.

    Regarding 'strip'; It has a POSIX specification, though the spec doesn't
    contain any arguments whatsoever.

    This makes our usage of 'strip' non-POSIX. That being said, our usage is
    compatible with these 'strip' implementations.

    strips: binutils, elfutils, elftoolchain, llvm, etc.

________________________________________________________________________________


    <span id=3.1><a href=#3.1>[3.1]</a></span> Runtime dependency detector built around 'ldd'
    ____________________________________________________________________________

    Dynamic dependencies brought in by build systems (which are missing from the
    package's dependency list) are fixed on-the-fly by checking which libraries
    link to the package's files.

    This prevents an incomplete dependency list from causing system breakage as
    the package manager is able to complete the list.

    A lot of packages make use of this "implicit" to "explicit" dependency list
    "conversion" to provide optional dependencies.

    <span id=3.2><a href=#3.2>[3.2]</a></span> Fully dynamic (and automatic) alternatives system
    ____________________________________________________________________________

    Any file conflicts between two packages automatically become choices in the
    alternatives system.

    This allows one to swap providers of files without needing to explicitly
    tell the package manager that two packages conflict, provide the same
    utilities, etc.

    In other words, no changes need to be made to packages. In fact, nothing
    needs to be done at all. It's entirely automatic.

    |                                                                          |
    |   $ kiss a | grep ^sbase | kiss a -                                      |
    |   -> Swapping '/usr/bin/cat' from busybox to sbase                       |
    |   -> Swapping '/usr/bin/cut' from busybox to sbase                       |
    |   -> Swapping '/usr/bin/yes' from busybox to sbase                       |
    |   ...Many more lines of output...                                        |
    |                                                                          |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    The above command works as the output of the alternatives listing is
    directly usable as input to 'kiss a'.


    <span id=3.3><a href=#3.3>[3.3]</a></span> 3-way handshake for files in /etc/
    ____________________________________________________________________________

    Files in /etc/ are handled differently to those elsewhere on the system. A
    reinstallation or update to a package will not always overwrite these files.

    Instead, a 3-way handshake happens during installation to determine how the
    new /etc/ file should be handled.

    If the user has made modifications to the file and those modifications
    differ to the to-be-installed package's file, the file is installed with the
    suffix '.new'

    If the user hasn't touched the file, it will be automatically overwritten by
    the package manager as it will contain updated/new contents..

    If the user has touched the file but the file has not changed between
    package versions, it will simply be skipped over.

<span id=4.0><a href=#4.0>[4.0]</a></span> Configuration
________________________________________________________________________________

The package manager has no configuration files and no changes need to be made to
the system prior to its use. While there is no configuration file, this does not
mean that there is no possibility for configuration.

The package manager can be configured via the use of environment variables. I
believe this to be the best configuration method (where realistic). Environment
variables can be set system-wide, per-user, conditionally, for a single
invocation, etc, etc.

They require little to no extra code in the package manager to support them.

There are also a myriad of "3rd-party" environment variables which control GCC,
Make, CMake, etc. These aren't used by the package manager. They're used by the
tools called by the package's build script.

<span id=5.0><a href=#5.0>[5.0]</a></span> Repositories
________________________________________________________________________________

Repository management in KISS is very simple. Repositories are configurable via
an environment variable. This environment variable can be set system-wide,
per-user, conditionally (via a script or program), for a single invocation, etc.

The environment variable is called 'KISS_PATH' and is functionally identical to
the '$PATH' variable. A colon separated list of paths, in other words.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Example KISS_PATH                                                            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                              |
|   $ KISS_PATH=/var/db/kiss/repo/core:/var/db/kiss/repo/extra                 |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

In the above example, two repositories are enabled (Core and Extra). The package
manager will search this list for packages in the order it is written.

Repositories can live anywhere on the system. In your '$HOME' directory,
somewhere system-wide in '/', etc. The only requirement is that a full path be
used.


    <span id=5.1><a href=#5.1>[5.1]</a></span> What is a repository?
    ____________________________________________________________________________

    A KISS repository is simply a directory of directories. The quickest way to
    get started is as follows.

    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 1. Create the repository                                                 |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                                          |
    |   $ mkdir -p repo                                                        |
    |   $ cd repo                                                              |
    |                                                                          |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 2. Let's 'fork' a few packages into our new repository.                  |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                                          |
    |  $ kiss fork curl                                                        |
    |  $ kiss fork xz                                                          |
    |  $ kiss fork zlib                                                        |
    |                                                                          |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    This is now a fully usable repository and it can be added to your KISS_PATH.


    <span id=5.2><a href=#5.2>[5.2]</a></span> Enabling a remote repository
    ____________________________________________________________________________

    Let's assume that our KISS_PATH matches the above example (Core and Extra).
    As an example, we'll be enabling the Community repository.

    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 1. Clone the repository                                                  |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                                          |
    |   # This can live anywhere on the system.                                |
    |   $ git clone <a href=https://github.com/kiss-community/community>https://github.com/kiss-community/community</a>                |
    |                                                                          |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 2. Enable the repository                                                 |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                                          |
    |   $ export KISS_PATH=$KISS_PATH:/path/to/community/community             |
    |                                                                          |

    <span id=5.3><a href=#5.3>[5.3]</a></span> Preventing a package from receiving updates
    ____________________________________________________________________________

    Preventing a package from receiving updates can be accomplished in a myriad
    of different ways. The easiest method is to leverage a user repository.

    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 1. Create a new repository                                               |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                                          |
    |   $ mkdir -p no_updates                                                  |
    |   $ cd no_updates                                                        |
    |                                                                          |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 2. Copy the package to the new repository                                |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                                          |
    |   $ cp -r /var/db/kiss/installed/PKG_NAME /path/to/no_updates            |
    |                                                                          |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 3. Add the new repository to the /START/ of your KISS_PATH               |

    |                                                                          |
    |   $ export KISS_PATH=/path/to/no_updates:$KISS_PATH                      |
    |                                                                          |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    The package manager will search KISS_PATH in order. It will see that the
    no_updates repository provides PKG_NAME and the version matches that which
    is installed. No updates will again happen for the package.


    <span id=5.4><a href=#5.4>[5.4]</a></span> Package fallbacks
    ____________________________________________________________________________

    If you would like to package something in your own repository but would
    like the package manager to prefer other repositories before yours, simply
    add your repository to the end of KISS_PATH.

    The moment that your package is available elsewhere, the package manager
    will prefer the new location to yours. The list is searched (in order) and
    the first match is picked.


    <span id=5.5><a href=#5.5>[5.5]</a></span> Bypassing KISS_PATH
    ____________________________________________________________________________

    There is a special case where one can bypass the regular KISS_PATH for a
    single invocation of the package manager. This has been called "CRUX-like
    usage" by users.

    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                                          |
    |   $ cd /path/to/myrepo/firefox                                           |
    |   $ kiss b                                                               |
    |   $ kiss i                                                               |
    |                                                                          |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    As seen above, various package manager commands will work without arguments,
    so long as you are in a package's repository directory. This will prepend
    the current directory to '$KISS_PATH' _only_ for this invocation.


<span id=6.0><a href=#6.0>[6.0]</a></span> Package Manager Hooks
________________________________________________________________________________

KISS' package manager is extensible via hooks which fire at various different
places inside the utility. Hooks allow the user to modify behavior, add new
features or conditionally do things on a per-package basis.

This setting is controlled by the '$KISS_HOOK' environment variable which takes
the full path to a POSIX shell script as its value.

Example:

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                              |
|  export KISS_HOOK=$HOME/.local/bin/kiss-hook                                 |
|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


    <span id=6.1><a href=#6.1>[6.1]</a></span> Usage
    ____________________________________________________________________________

    The script is sourced at each hook and is given three variables as input.
    POSIX shell does not allow sourced scripts to receive arguments, these
    variables are instead defined via the script's environment.

    - '$PKG':  The name of the current package.
    - '$TYPE': The type of hook.
    - '$DEST': The location where 'make install' will put files.

    Valid values for '$TYPE' include:

        pre-build,   post-build,   build-fail,
        pre-install, post-install, pre-extract,
        post-package.

    As the hook script is sourced (instead of being executed in its own shell),
    the script has the ability to override package manager internals and the
    package manager's environment.


    <span id=6.2><a href=#6.2>[6.2]</a></span> Removing unneeded files from packages
    ____________________________________________________________________________

    Packages can contain files which you will have no use for. A simple hook can
    be defined to remove them from packages.

    NOTE: This is the default 'KISS_HOOK' script. If defining your own, be sure
          to include this if you would like to continue to remove these files.

    <span id=6.3><a href=#6.3>[6.3]</a></span> Building some packages in memory (tmpfs)
    ____________________________________________________________________________

    This hook runs on pre-extract and conditionally runs the source extraction,
    package build process and resulting tarball creation in memory. The benefit
    of this is a nice speedup throughout (especially when used alongside
    ccache).

    NOTE: '/tmp' must be mounted as 'tmpfs' for this to work.

<span id=7.0><a href=#7.0>[7.0]</a></span> Package Manager Extensions
________________________________________________________________________________

Anything in the user's '$PATH' which matches the glob 'kiss-*' will be directly
usable via the package manager. For example, 'kiss-size' is also usable as
'kiss size' (and even 'kiss si') (the shortest available alias).

The detected 'kiss-*' utilities will appear in the package manager's help output
with the second line in the script acting as a doc-string.

Example help output:

These are optional utilities which interact with the package system in one way
or another. My hope behind them is to act as an example for how easy it is to
interface with the plain-text and "static" package system.

Example utility:

<span id=8.0><a href=#8.0>[8.0]</a></span> Tips and Tricks
________________________________________________________________________________

A lot of the package manager's features are hard to discover or otherwise
non-obvious to its users. This section will document these features, how to use
them and the benefits they bring.


    <span id=8.1><a href=#8.1>[8.1]</a></span> Swap grep implementations for a major speed up.
    ____________________________________________________________________________

    The default grep implementation in KISS is busybox grep. This version of
    grep works very well and supports a large number of features. The one issue
    is that it is painfully slow when compared to other popular implementations.

    A fairly major speedup can be attained by swapping to a different grep via
    the alternatives system. The fastest grep implementation around is GNU grep
    which is available in Community as 'gnugrep'.

    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 1. Install GNU grep                                                      |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                                          |
    |  $ kiss b gnugrep && kiss i gnugrep                                      |
    |                                                                          |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | 2. Swap to GNU grep                                                      |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |                                                                          |
    |  $ kiss a gnugrep /usr/bin/grep                                          |
    |                                                                          |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    <span id=8.2><a href=#8.2>[8.2]</a></span> Shallow cloning
    ____________________________________________________________________________

    By default, the package manager performs a shallow clone of the remote
    repository, branch, or commit whenever possible. This is to speedup cloning,
    and for most packages does not alter the package building process. This
    shallow cloning is done in a way which still allows git --describe.

    For packages which require submodules, add 'git submodule update --init' to
    pull in the required submodules.
